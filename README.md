  ## Installation
  If you would like to install the code, all you have to do is make sure you clone this repo onto whatever device you are using. Once you've done that, open your terminal and run the command npm install to make sure you have all the dependancies. After that, its as simple as running npm start in your terminal you've got yourself a working react profile application. 

  ## Usage
  Use this code to create a profile all your own! Or, if you just want to use the finished product, go ahead and stare at my info for a bit. You're welcome around here anytime you want.

  ## Contribution
  For now, it is just a rough sketch of what I would like it to look like eventually. I would definitely like to add animation to the sight, and add some flairs that would really make it unique, more than just a typical web developer's profile page.
